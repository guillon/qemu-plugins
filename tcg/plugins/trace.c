 * Note that the trace interleaves execution from different CPUs
 * and threads.
 *
 * Scope:
 * - linux-user: ok
 * - linux-user threaded: ok
 * - bsd-user: not compiled, not tested
 * - bsd-user threaded: not compiled, not tested
 * - system: not compiled, not tested
 * - generic: yes
 * - archs: all
